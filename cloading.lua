-- setting this to false will NOT mute the sound as soon as the game loads 
-- (you will hear background noises while on the loading screen, so not recommended)

------- Code -------

-- Sometimes this gets called too early, but sometimes it's perfectly timed,
-- we need this to be as early as possible, without it being TOO early, it's a gamble!
